Histogram in cuda

In order to build you must run

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

This will yield 4 programs
./comparison
./graph
./histogram

./comparison utilization:
Usage: ./comparison -i <BinNum> <VecDim> <GridSize> this runs the main program which compares tiled vs optimized vs naive kernels
  <BinNum>: is the number of bins (any integer that can be written as 2^k where k can be any integer from 2 to 8).
  <VecDim>: is the dimension of the input vector
  <GridSize>: gridsize which is used for tiled and optimized kernel should input some value above 256, I use 256,512,1024

./histogram -i <BinNum> <VecDim> <GridSize> this runs just the optimized kernel.
  <BinNum>: is the number of bins (any integer that can be written as 2^k where k can be any integer from 2 to 8).
  <VecDim>: is the dimension of the input vector
  <GridSize>: gridsize which is used for tiled and optimized kernel should input some value above 256, I use 256,512,1024

./graph -i <VecDim> <GridSize> this program runs through all bins 4,8,16,32,64,128,256 and returns the values in a csv file.
  <VecDim>: Number of columns in matrix A (and number of rows in matrix B)
  <GridSize>: Number of columns in matrix B and matrix C
